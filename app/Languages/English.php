				"Hi! I´m Fabricio Vega, I´m  " . $year . " years old, and I am a Software Engineer and Bachelor of Business Administration. 
				<br>
				Since I was little I have been a lover of mathematics, soccer and today, a lover of creating websites, custom web software and mobile applications.
				<br>
				My passion changed around the age of 19, going from training daily on soccer fields, to being at a desk typing large amounts of lines of code to create fascinating things.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong style='font-weight: bold;'>Mission:</strong> <br> 
				Visualize needs in the population so that, with knowledge in the technological environment, I can contribute my bit.
				<br>
				Every time I go to a website where 'X' service is offered and they are flooded with advertising, my eyes water and I try to develop something similar.
				<br>
				I want to be able to help small entrepreneurs with the creation of technological levers that allow them to project their business to another level.
				<br>
				This has become a real hobby for me.",
				"Phrase" => "Once a philosopher said: 'Pleasure in the trade brings perfection in work.' many years ago I was curious about how to develop websites, so that I could upload the knowledge acquired in my business administration career to a web platform, so empirically at the time I started the journey that today is my greatest passion , with which I have managed to develop more than 100 personal and business projects. Adding to that great passion, I can highlight the fascination for graphic design and the love to soccer. For many things I can say that I am passionate about what I do and a person truly loyal to those who show me their affection.",
